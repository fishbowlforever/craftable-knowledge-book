Allows you to craft a Knowlege Book with Green Dye + Book. They are special Knowledge Books which can be stacked up to 64 (Usually, they cannot be stacked).

The Knowledge Book has no use on its own other than displaying it in an Item Frame and being interesting to own because it is normally unobtainable but can be useful in other Datapacks.
